ive banged up a super simple kidstruments upload info site on google sites, should work until we get a better solution:
https://sites.google.com/view/makeakidstrument/home


and i reckon for now just direct the 'collaborate with us' button to here: https://www.playablestreets.com/playableweb  

I'll tweak it a bit but it pretty much has all the info needed!
